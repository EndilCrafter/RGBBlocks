Minecraft has a few dye colours, and that is fine.
There's the essentials. And what can you colour with them?
Right, the essentials - wool, wood, stone, basically everything you need to col - wait.
You can't. But hey you have... terracotta! And... glazed terracotta! Great!
Well... Not that much. So you'll just have to resort to the colours minecraft's nature provides you...
Or, if it gave you some red, some green and some blue dye, you could simply throw those into a bucket of water and gain access to a few more colors.
It's all you need. Plus some blocks. We took care of that.

### This mod adds multiple blocks that can be colored in 16,777,216 colours, using the Paint Bucket.

Additionally, you get an assortment of different blocks which provide you with some useful patterns that you can then paint in any colour.
